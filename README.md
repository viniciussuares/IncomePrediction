# Income Prediction Based on Sociodemographic Variables

## Objective

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to estimate the income of individuals based on sociodemographic and occupational variables, using microdata from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) collected by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).

## Problem and Relevance

Accurate income prediction is essential for:

- **Market Segmentation:** Enhancing targeted marketing and increasing ROI.
- **Credit Policies:** Reducing default rates and improving credit portfolio profitability
- **Product Personalization:** Tailoring offers to consumer purchasing power, boosting customer satisfaction.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection**
   - **Initial Selection:** Chose relavant columns based on domain knowledge, intuition and the available data dictionaries. 
   - **Data Retrieval:** Used SQL through Python to request data from Base dos Dados public Data Lake on BigQuery.
   - **Results:** Collected 794,507 rows and 15 columns, saving in a compressed CSV file 
   - **Performance**: Query completed in approximately 2 minutes
